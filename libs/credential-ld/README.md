# @tw-did/credential-ld

## Overview

`@tw-did/credential-ld` is a lightweight version of `@veramo/credential-ld`. While the latter works well in a Node.js environment, it faces challenges when operating in a browser setting. The primary aim of `@tw-did/credential-ld` is to provide a simplified, yet fully compatible alternative, focusing on facilitating the development of SemaphoreSignature2023.

## Problem Statement

The issue with `@veramo/credential-ld` is its inability to function seamlessly in browser environments. This has led to the temporary solution of creating `@tw-did/credential-ld`.

## Solution

This package aims to allow SemaphoreSignature2023 to function properly by offering a compatible and simplified version of `@veramo/credential-ld`.

## Deprecation Notice

Please note that this library will be deprecated as soon as `@veramo/credential-ld` becomes fully operational in browser environments.
